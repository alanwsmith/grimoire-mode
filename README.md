# grimoire-mode 

A Grimoire For Emacs Org-mode

## TODO

- [] - Commit changes to git
- [] - Only update files that changed in the search index
- [] - Remove files that have been delted or renamed from the search index
- [] - Setup after save hook so that it only runs in the grimiore (or maybe just org mode)
