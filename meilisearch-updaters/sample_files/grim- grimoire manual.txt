I'm writing this in the style of a future press.
release. That's to say, the language speaks as if
all the features are done. Those marked as in
progress are still underway, but I like the
stronger language. 


** Tangled Config Files

- Lots of emacs config is managed from the
  grimoire. The nonce facet for files containg
  config stuff is `config-`. Output from the
  tangled process goes into
  `~/workshop/dotfiles.alanwsmith.com/dotfiles/emacs/tangled-files`

- Everything in that directory is loaded when
  emacs starts up

- File names are set explicity in the `:tangled`
  call of the source blocks so the originating
  files can be renamed without problem. 

  

** Source Blocks

- Optionally use `#+NAME: listing_description` to
  put blocks in one part of the file and then show
  them in another part with
  `#+LISTING: listing_description`. (NOTE that the
  name is the same so you can just copy/paste the
  line and switch `NAME` to `LISTING`

  The blocks won't show up in the initial location
  and will only show where they are output with
  `#+LISTING: listing_description`
 
- Use optional `#+:FILENAME: dir/name.txt` to set
  the filename that will show up above source code
  blocks (and don't use `:tangled` names since those
  can be different)

- Use `#+NAME: hidden_description` to prevent a
  source block from being output when the site is
  built.




** Hidding Content

- IN PROGRESS: Souce code blocks who's name starts with
  `HIDDEN` aren't output when the pages is built for
  the site. That provides for a way to have concices
  notes at the top of a reference while providing the
  full prose for the site.

- IN PROGRESS: Source code blocks who's name starts with
  `LISTING` don't appear directly when the pages is
  output for the site. They are inserted back into the
  page with a slug that looks like `@@LISTING-TOKEN@@`.
  This lets the listings show up at the top of the page
  in the local reference while inserting them in the
  prose on the site. 


** Formatting Results

- There's a results formatter in place that adds
  empty lines at the top and bottom of results and
  pads them in two spaces to make them look better.

- IN PROGRESS: The formatter also wraps longer lines
  by default. That can be turned off in the
  call to it. 


** Searching

- Post with work and personal nonce- words are filtered out
  by default to prevent doxing during streaming

- To view everything, prefix the search with `all-`. For
  example: `all- personal- first computer`. You can also
  skip the second none word
